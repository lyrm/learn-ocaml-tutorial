## What is to learn in this step ?

* Signature of all three test functions for functions

* Purpose of each optional arguments and link to the right tutorial to learn how to use them

## What you will not learn in this step

* How to write non-trivial exercises. See the documentation for 
[this step](https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml/blob/master/docs/tutorials/step-5.md) or the 
[index](https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml/blob/master/docs/howto-write-exercises.md)
  to find the right one.
